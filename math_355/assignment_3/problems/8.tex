\section{Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ where $a<b$
     and let $M = \sup_{a\leq x \leq b} (\abs{f(x)})$.}

     \subsection{If $M > 0$ and $p$ is any positive constant,
        show that for every $\e > 0$
        there are constants $c<d$ 
        so that $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$
        and
        \[
            \bm{
                (M-\e)^p (d-c) 
                \leq 
                \int_a^b \abs{f(x)}^p dx 
                \leq
                M^p(d-a)
            }
        \]
    }

    \subsection{Prove that
        \[
            \bm{
                \lim_{p\to \infty}\left(\int_a^b \abs{f(x)}^p dx \right )^{\frac{1}{p}} = M
